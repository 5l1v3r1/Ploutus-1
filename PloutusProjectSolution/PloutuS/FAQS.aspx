                                on the number of words) of text. It will be saved in an ASCII format. - Text with
                                bold, underlines, italics, fancy or large characteristics will be accepted but only
                                as ASCII text and thus these formats will not appear in their original form. - If
                                you are having trouble pasting your resume, try a few paragraphs at a time. - Or,
                                save your resume under a common word processor using either .txt (Text) or .asc
                                (ASCII) format under the "Save As" feature. - If you are still not pleased with
                                the format of your resume, don't worry! We look for experience and content rather
                                than the look and feel of the resume.
